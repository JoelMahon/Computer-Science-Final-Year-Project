Welcome to my program "Animation of Algorithms", created by Joel Mahon, email jm700, student id 159020527

This is the README for just the executable, if you want the README for the
"software solution" as a whole please see code/README.txt (relative to the root of the SVN repo for me, jm700)

Otherwise if you are in the Release folder, then all you need to do is run the AnimationOfAlgorithms.exe,
if you are in the Debug folder you will need a recent Windows SDK installed, more details in the other README.

If you are in neither of those folders and are in an installed folder under Program Files/JM700/AnimationOfAlgorithms
then you will need to run as administrator if you wish to persist your settings between executions.

Your system should be 64-bit Windows 10 with OpenGL 3.3 compatible drivers installed,
otherwise your program may not run correctly.
