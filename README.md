# Computer-Science-Final-Year-Project
The code, release, installer, and disseration of my final year project for me Computer Science degree.

Your system should be 64-bit Windows 10 with OpenGL 3.3 compatible drivers installed,
otherwise your program may not run correctly.

To compile and run the software from the original code you must:
	1. Comply with the above compatibility requirements.
	2. Have Visual Studio 2017 Community installed with all the C++ packages included.
	3. Open AnimationOfAlgorithms\AnimationOfAlgorithms.sln
	4. Make sure you are set to build "Release" "x64".
	5. Build.
	6. Then the executable and all required files will be located in AnimationOfAlgorithms\bin\x64\Release

To activate the executable itself, navigate to AnimationOfAlgorithms\bin\x64\Release and run AnimationOfAlgorithms.exe

Alternatively to just run the executable, a pre built copy of the release is located in Release, navigate to it and run AnimationOfAlgorithms.exe.

There is also an installer located in installer, to install my program using it you just need to run it
and you will be presented with a wizard, just click "next" until you have to click "cancel" because it done, it will install
my program into a new folder "Program Files\JM700" on your default disk.

The same installer can be run to uninstall my program.

To run the newly installed program navigate to "Program Files\JM700\AnimationOfAlgorithms" and run AnimationOfAlgorithms.exe.

If running the installed version then you will need to run "as administrator" if you wish to persist your settings between executions.
